#check number of rows in input - this gives length of problem
# initialise matching number of arrays and store in a master array
# turn each row of input into an array of characters
# iterate through and for each character, by index, push into corresponding array in master array
# for each array, check if contains * or +, then delete final element and multiply or add all other elements together
